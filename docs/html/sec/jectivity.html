<h2>Surjectivity</h2>
<p>In this section we'll define some special classes of functions. The first consists of functions that "hit" every element of the codomain.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><a name='crossref-0'></a> Let <span class="math inline">\(f : A \rightarrow B\)</span> be a function. We say that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>surjective</em> if for every <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span>, there is an <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes this property is called <em>onto</em>, as in <span class="math inline">\(f : A \rightarrow B\)</span> is <em>onto</em> <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This terminology is grammatically dubious, so I prefer to avoid it, but it's common in older literature. It's also instructive to note that surjectivity is "dual" to totality; the total property of a function means that every element of the domain is an input, while surjectivity means that every element in the codomain is an output.</p>
<p>Showing that a function is surjective usually involves choosing an arbitrary element of the codomain and showing it is the image of some element in the domain. Our first example is pretty boring.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><a name='crossref-1'></a> The identity function <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A\)</span> on a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is surjective.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(a = \mathsf{id}_A(a)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> was arbitrary in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A\)</span> is surjective.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Slightly less trivial, the composite of surjective functions is surjective.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f : A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g : B \rightarrow C\)</span> be functions. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are surjective, then <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is surjective.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is surjective, there is a <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(g(b) = c\)</span>. Similarly, since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective, there is an <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = b\)</span>. Now <span class="math display">\[(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c.\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> was arbitrary in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is surjective as claimed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section class="level2">
<h2>Injectivity</h2>
<p>Where surjectivity was dual to totality, well-definedness also has a dual, called <em>injectivity</em>. These are functions which send distinct inputs to distinct outputs.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><a name='crossref-2'></a> Let <span class="math inline">\(f : A \rightarrow B\)</span> be a function. We say <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>injective</em> if whenever <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2 \in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(a_1 = a_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This property is sometimes called <em>one-to-one</em>, but again I'll prefer injective. (Even <em>two-to-two</em> would be better than one-to-one, since that more accurately reflects what it means.) Showing that a function is injective usually involves setting up an equality <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(y)\)</span> for arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and showing that <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><a name='crossref-3'></a> The identity function <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A\)</span> is injective.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2 \in A\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A(a_1) = \mathsf{id}_A(a_2)\)</span>. Using the definition of <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[a_1 = \mathsf{id}_A(a_1) = \mathsf{id}_A(a_2) = a_2.\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> were arbitrary, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{id}_A\)</span> is injective as claimed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The composite of injective functions is again injective.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f : A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g : B \rightarrow C\)</span> be functions. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are injective, then <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is also injective.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2 \in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((g \circ f)(a_1) = (g \circ f)(a_2)\)</span>. Now <span class="math display">\[g(f(a_1)) = (g \circ f)(a_1) = (g \circ f)(a_2) = g(f(a_2)).\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is injective, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\)</span>, and because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective, we have <span class="math inline">\(a_1 = a_2\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> were arbitrary in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is injective as claimed.</p>
